I am a trained architect ‚úèÔ∏è with a few years of experience in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) field, currently becoming a front-end web developer üíª 

I followed in 2019 the fullstack training of The Hacking Project, and have worked occasionally for individuals on web projects.

As an architect, I developed custom tools to automate tasks üöÄ (`RhinoPython`, Illustrator + `Javascript`, Google Spreadsheet + `JavaScript`) and improve the production workflow.

Within the framework of the association [MLAV.LAND](http://www.mlav.land), of which I am the co-founder, I also had the opportunity to experiment üîç with programmed systems (`Python`, `Arduino`, `Raspberry`) for the realization of artistic installations, and to produce web projects with artistic (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`) and documentary (`Airtable`, `Ruby on Rails`) purposes.

I am currently learning React for specializing in front-end development.
