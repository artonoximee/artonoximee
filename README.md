I am a trained architect ✏️ with a few years of experience in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) field.

I am currently becoming a front-end web developer 💻 I followed in 2019 the fullstack training of The Hacking Project, and have worked occasionally for individuals on web projects.

I know :
- `HTML`
- `CSS` (& `Bootstrap`)
- `Vanilla JS`
- `Ruby on Rails`
- `Git` and `GitHub`

And I am currently learning:
- `React`
- `SASS`
- `Node.js`

As an architect, I developed custom tools to automate tasks 🚀 (`RhinoPython`, Illustrator + `Javascript`, Google Spreadsheet + `JavaScript`) and improve the production workflow.

Within the framework of the association MLAV.LAND, of which I am the co-founder, I also had the opportunity to experiment 🔍 with programmed systems (`Python`, `Arduino`, `Raspberry`) for the realization of artistic installations, and to produce web projects with artistic (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`) and documentary (`Airtable`, `Ruby on Rails`) purposes.
